WHUMP v0.x

To use: replace the 4 WHUMP tags (WHUMP_TITLE, WHUMP_HEADER, WHUMP_FOOTER WHUMP_INIT) with better contents (can be done manually or via PHP etc)

The WHUMP_INIT tag should include javascript, including one or more: 

request_db("filename.txt")

whereas filename.txt can be a URL, and the contents of which should be zero or more lines of (tab delimited):

  ; Prepopulated playlist item:
  pre	URL

  ; Item in database:
  item	URL	length_in_seconds

WHUMP_INIT can also override the following functions:

db_fntitle(), pl_fntitle(), and fntourl()

each of these take the URL from the database line, and return strings for the left (database) pane, the playlist/now playing display, or the HTML5 <audio tag>.


That is all!
